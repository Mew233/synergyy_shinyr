# synergyy_shinyr
This Shiny app is tailored to compare predictions side-by-side, which are output by deep learning models from the synergyy python package. The app will automatically display probablities plot and shap analysis* according to the user's input.


#### Usage
This app has embeded prediction results on DrugComb, and Sanger 2022. The data/ directory also includes jupyternotebook, to help construct the dataframe from the end output of synergyy pacakge.

*Due to the file size, we only display several drug combos for shap visualisation.
